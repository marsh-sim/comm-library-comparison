# Communication Library Comparison

Minimal examples to check selected libraries from "Proposed options for simulator architecture" document

## Roadmap

- [x] MQTT
  - Industrial Communication Toolbox doesn't include any Simulink blocks, corroborated by existence of a [commercial option](https://www.speedgoat.com/products/mqtt-client)
- [ ] Data Distribution Service
- [ ] ZeroMQ
- [ ] MAVLink

## Installation

_Optional, but recommended: create and activate Python virtual environment_

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### MQTT

Windows installer for [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/download/)
